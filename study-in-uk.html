        <p class="sub-heading"> The general student visa (Tier 4) is preferred by the majority of students between the age of 16 or above. This process is a point-based system. The student will be awarded 40 points; 30 points will be awards for the confirmation of acceptance
            of studies (CAS) and 10 points will be given for an income certificate to show that the student has adequate financial resources to shore up his tuition fee and living costs. The UK grants you a short-term student visa if you are studying
            a short course. This visa is valid for 6-11 months. If you are opting for a longer course, choose universities that enable a Tier 4 (General) sponsor license. Here is a piece of vivid information and cost that goes into the visa process in
