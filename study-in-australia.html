        <h3 class="title-bold"> Reasons to Study in Australia</h3> <br>
        <p class="sub-heading">
            There are many reasons to study in Australia.
            <b> Excellence </b> <br> The Australian approach to vocational and technical education is now recognised as among the best and most innovative in the world. It enjoys an international reputation for excellence in all areas of education and
            training. Australian universities are widely recognised for excellence in many disciplines.Institutions deliver practical and career-orientated training so graduates can be confident they have the skills demanded by employers. It has played
            an important role in Australia's economic performance, by greatly increasing the skill of workers and contributing to improved productivity. <br> <br>

            <b> Innovation </b> <br> Australia has a reputation for adopting new technologies at a faster rate than in most other countries and enters the new millennium with one of the highest rates of internet access in the world. Facilities for teaching,
            training and research are world-class in terms of state-of- the-art laboratories and classrooms, outstanding libraries and modern technology. <br> <br>

            <b> Qualification recognition </b> <br> Australian qualifications are recognised by employers and leading educational institutions in many countries around the world. Moreover, most courses and training undertaken by international students
            in Australia are covered by Australian Qualification Framework (AQF). It is a system of learning which is authorised by the Australian government. <br> <br>

            <b> Quality assurances </b> <br> Australia's national quality assurance system is unique both in its structure and its rigour. International students, and even their parents, enjoy an unparalleled level of service and financial protection.
            The country is committed to providing quality education to students -- be it national or international. <br> The Australian Quality Training Framework has been set up by the government to strengthen the quality assurance processes to study
            in Australia. Australia provides the world's most rigourous protection for international students through ESOS. <br> <br>

            <b> Multicultural society </b> <br> Australia is a safe, multicultural, friendly and harmonious society. Australians value the wealth of cultural diversity and social sophistication that international students bring to the campuses and communities.
            <br> Great care is taken in looking after international students and helping them to adjust to the Australian way of life. Australia has a low crime rate and strict gun control laws providing a safe environment. <br> One's study plans are
            also not likely to be upset by political turmoil. People from about 200 countries have migrated to Australia, making Australia one of the most culturally diverse countries in the world. The multicultural nature of Australian society means
            international students are readily accepted by other students, and teachers are experienced in teaching classes to students from many countries. <br> <br>

            <b> Visa red-tapism </b> <br> Most of us are familiar with the high-handedness of the American and the British visa officials. On any given day, a genuine visa application may get turned down for reasons best known to them. This is gradually
            going in favour of new academic destinations. <br> Students are more or less frustrated about the lengthy and costly visa application procedure for the US and UK. The Guardian has recently published a report saying UK visas should address
            the problems encountered by one-third of students in obtaining visas -- 18 per cent found it a lengthy and difficult process even though their first application was eventually successful, 8 per cent were initially refused but received a visa
            on a second application and 5 per cent received one after appealing their initial refusal. <br> <br>

            <b> Cost of living </b> <br> Australia’s standard of living is amongst the highest in the world. Living expenses and tuition costs are considerably lower in Australia than they are in the United States and United Kingdom. International students
            are able to work part time while they study, allowing them to offset their living costs. There is also the possibility of scholarships, which can help to lower the cost of studying in Australia for international students. In Australia, a student
            gets value for money in terms of cost of living. The conversion factor is cheaper compared to the UK or US.

        <h3 class="title-bold"> Study in Australia Cost</h3>
        <p class="sub-heading">
            Australia has been the major crowd-pleaser for its brilliant cost benefiting factor. The study in Australia cost is relatively affordable and cheaper than that of the UK, USA and any other European countries. There is a large amount of undergraduate and
            master-degree courses that the Australian Universities offer in the streams of science and arts. Unlike the Indian private universities, the Australian private Universities are quite affordable and public Universities are maintained flawlessly.
            The tuition fee depends upon the University you choose, while the cost of living is appealingly economical. <br> <br> In order to motivate the students, the Australian Universities offer a wide range of scholarship schemes intended
            to the potential students. This also curbs the expenses of the students. Here is an abstract idea to study in Australia cost.

        <h3 class="title-bold">Visa Fees and Visa Process Duration</h3>

        <p class="sub-heading">>The cost of all the subclass visas for students is AUD$ 550. The Australian Government does not require you to have a visa label in your passport to travel to, enter or remain in Australia. But if you want the visa sticker on your passport, you
            can request and pay for a visa label if you already have a student visa. It is Australian Government policy to charge for visa labels. The charge for a visa label is AUD 150.
        </p>

        <p class="sub-heading">There are three assessment levels in the student visa program. They align student visa requirements to the immigration risk posed by applicants from a particular country studying in a particular education sector. Assessment level 1 represents
            the lowest immigration risk and assessment level 3 the highest. The higher the assessment level, the greater the evidence an applicant is required to demonstrate to support their claims for the grant of a student visa. Maximum duration is
            90 working days.
        </p>
        <p class="sub-heading">Visas are the agreement passes that most of the sovereign states grant for the traveler’s entry for a specific purpose. The visa process is time-consuming so you don’t want that last-minute rigidity. Therefore apply to the earliest possible as
            it might take four weeks before you will be contacted. Once you receive the CoE from the university(s), the visa application process begins.
